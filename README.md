"# KonwMuzyczne" 
The aim of the project is to organize the code and content structure.

At the moment the content is not separated from the code. There are no templates files used (header, footer). There is no database for storing content and no CMS.

The steps to solve those problems are as follows:
- create DB to store content
- create templates
- create CMS (customer does not want to use popular CMS like WordPress)
- create folder structure and organize files into folders
- use procedural PHP to create prototype
- once accepted by customer develope code and move it to OOP PHP and design patterns like MVC
