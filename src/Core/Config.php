    Use Singleton pattern

    This class reads the config file and converts it to the array during instantiation.
    It is very expensive operation (reading file, conversion). Data from config file may be needed in different parts of programm.
    It is good to instantiate this class only once.
    Using static doesn't ensure, that the class will not be instantiated again.
    The best soultion is to use Singleton Pattern.

    Implementing a singleton implies the following points:
    1. Make the constructor of the class private, so absolutely no one from outside
    the class can ever instantiate that class.
    2. Create a static property named $instance, which will contain an instance of
    itself—that is, in our Config class, the $instance property will contain an
    instance of the class Config.
    3. Create a static method, getInstance, which will check if $instance is null,
    and if it is, it will create a new instance using the private constructor. Either
    way, it will return the $instance property.
